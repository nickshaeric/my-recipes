    <h1>Matcha Pancakes</h1>

    <img src="../images/matchaPancakes.jpg" alt="Matcha Pancakes"">

    <p><strong>These matcha pancakes are a treat.</strong></p>
    <p>We're strong believers in sleeping in and brunching on the weekends 
        <em>(we didn't work hard all week for nothing!)</em>, 
        so it's only natural that we treat ourselves to one of our favorite brunch foods: the classic pancake.</p>
    <p>There's just something about stacks of fluffy, buttery breakfast cakes that make us feel like we're starting 
       the morning off with dessert, especially if chocolate chips are inside.</p>
    <p><strong>Happy brunching!</strong> Top with more white chocolate chips, honey, and butter, and enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> <h3>Step One</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center of mixture; 
                    add 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon cashew milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla to the well.</li>
                <li> Whisk batter briefly until just a few small clumps of flour remain.</li>
                <li>Add chocolate chips; stir again briefly.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <h3>Step Two</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grease a small saucepan lightly; heat over medium-low heat.</li>
                <li>Transfer 2 to 3 spoonfuls batter onto the center of the pan, 
                    spreading batter with the back of the spoon.</li>
                <li> Cook until small bubbles rise to the surface and burst, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Flip and cook until the edges are lightly golden brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
